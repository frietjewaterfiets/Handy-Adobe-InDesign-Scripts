**InDesign Rapid Frame Filler**

These scripts let you instantly resize shapes and image frames to perfectly fill your InDesign pages — with bleed or within margins.”

🚀 **Installation**

1. Open Adobe InDesign.
2. Press Ctrl + Alt + F11 to open the Scripts panel.
3. Right-click the User folder and choose Show in Explorer (or Finder on Mac).
4. Open the folder called Scripts Panel.
5. Drag & drop both scripts into this folder.
6. Back in InDesign, the scripts will now appear in your Scripts panel.
7. Assign keyboard shortcuts for rapid use:

**Recommended:**

Ctrl + Alt + F → Margin Filler

Ctrl + Alt + D → Full Bleed Filler

📖 **Usage**
1. Select any shape or image frame on your page.
2. Run one of the scripts from the Scripts panel (or use your shortcut).
3. The frame will automatically resize:
4. Margin Filler → fits neatly within your page margins.
5. Full Filler → expands to cover the entire page + bleed.
6. If the frame contains an image, the content will scale proportionally to fill the frame.

These scripts only auto-fit images placed inside rectangular frames.
Placed PDFs  will not be resized automatically — the frame will resize, but the content will not scale.
